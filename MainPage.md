## Human-Computer Interaction Portfolio

### About Me:

  Hello, my name is Robert Dutile.  I am, at the time of this writing, a sophomore computer-science major at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.  In this portfolio I will be linking reports on several of the projects that I worked on as part of various groups while in A class on Human Computer interaction.
