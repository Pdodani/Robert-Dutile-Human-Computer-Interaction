## Human-Computer Interaction Portfolio

### About Me:

  Hello, my name is Robert Dutile.  I am, at the time of this writing, a sophomore computer-science major at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.  In this portfolio I will be linking reports on several of the projects that I worked on as part of various groups while in A class on Human Computer interaction.

### Good and Bad Design:

This project was unique amongst the rest of those showcased here, in that it was not a group project.  I essentially just had to find and write a report on an example of good and bad design around the campus.  This was very much an introductory project.

### Design For Others

For this project, I worked with Pawan Dodani and Alec Kohlhoff to propose a way to redesign a website for a particular demographic.

### Design for Understanding

For this project, I worked with David Larson and Pawan Dodani to choose a data set and create several visualizations based on it, shifting style for improved accuracy or persuasion.

### Design for Tension

Now this was an interesting one.  I worked with Michael Gonsalves, Nikolas Gamarra and Gavin MacNeal on this.  We had to design a chat bot that helped provide information on a controversial issue of our choice.

### Design for Wellbeing

This prject was a collaboration between myself, Trevor Dowd, Alazar Genene and Trevor Goldstein.  We were tasked with designing a webpage that utilized the Affectiva Javascript library in some helpful fashion.
