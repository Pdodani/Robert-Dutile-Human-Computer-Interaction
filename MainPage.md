## Human-Computer Interaction Portfolio

### About Me:

  Hello, my name is Robert Dutile.  I am, at the time of this writing, a sophomore computer-science major at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.  In this portfolio I will be linking reports on several of the projects that I worked on as part of various groups while in A class on Human Computer interaction.

### Good and Bad Design:

This project was unique amongst the rest of those showcased here, in that it was not a group project.  I essentially just had to find and write a report on an example of good and bad design around the campus.  This was very much an introductory project.
